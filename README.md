## Key Features

This repository provides the official implementation of NormPULSE.

Key feature bulletin points here
- A knowledge transfer approach that utilizes data distillation from LLMs through prompt engineering, converting short clinical terms into knowledge cards that contain enhanced information and clinical knowledge.
- Leverage the hierarchical structure in the standard term and develop an algorithm for building the tree structure with ICD codes.
- A generative framework, to find the candidate terms via knowledge-enhanced retrieval and generate the final standard term with hierarchical reasoning.

## Details

We outline the comprehensive framework of our solution to clinical term normalization, NormPULSE, which is based on PULSE and comprises three steps: 
1. Training, There are three tasks in the training step, knowledge card generation, aiming at enhancing the knowledge inside term by distilling knowledge from LLM; hierarchical tree construction based on the ICD codes and term normalization, making the model get the ability to select the standard terms from a certain candidate list.  
2. knowledge-enhanced retrieval, the model retrieves candidates for the given mention using the generated knowledge cards and locates each candidate's path in the constructed hierarchical tree to build a subtree.
3. hierarchical reasoning, the model reasons out the final result layer by layer through the subtree.
